# MIRNet-TFLite

This repository shows the TensorFlow Lite model conversion and inference processes for the **MIRNet** model as proposed by [Learning Enriched Features for Real Image Restoration and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06792v2.pdf). This model is capable of enhancing low-light images upto a great extent.
